# Eye Diseases Classification üëÅÔ∏è

Early detection of eye diseases is vital to preserve vision and prevent irreversible damage. Many eye conditions, such as diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma, may exhibit few or no symptoms in their initial stages, making timely diagnosis crucial. By the time symptoms appear, the disease may have progressed to a point where it is much harder to treat. Early detection also provides an opportunity to start appropriate treatment that can help manage the condition and prevent vision loss. Consequently, early detection of these diseases is so crucial because people can lose their vision.

Our project focuses on Eye Diseases Classification, utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify Normal, Diabetic Retinopathy, Cataract, and Glaucoma retinal images. The dataset consists of approximately 1000 images for each class, collected from various sources such as IDRiD, Oculur recognition, and HRF.

**Examples:**

**Cataracts**: Cataracts are a common age-related condition in which the lens of the eye becomes cloudy, causing blurry vision and sensitivity to light. Surgery is the most common treatment for cataracts.

**Diabetic Retinopathy**: Diabetic Retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that affects the retina and can lead to vision loss. High blood sugar levels can damage blood vessels in the retina and cause them to leak or swell, leading to vision problems.

**Glaucoma**: Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss. It is often caused by increased pressure in the eye, although not all cases of glaucoma have elevated eye pressure. Early detection and treatment are important in preventing vision loss from glaucoma, which has no cure.

**Normal**

For this classification, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with convolution stages (Conv2d, ReLU, MaxPool2d) and a fully connected layer at the end. Our aim is to facilitate healthcare professionals in identifying eye diseases promptly, allowing for timely interventions to prevent vision loss. Join us in this impactful endeavor as we utilize cutting-edge technology to make a difference in the field of ophthalmology.
